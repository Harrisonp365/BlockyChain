# BlockyChain

This repo includes BlockyChain v1 in a seperate file. V1 was a very simple project that was a start to see the bare fundamentals of developing a blockchain. 
The first version has the ability to mine a hardcoded amount of blocks. The difficulty is also hardcoded but can be adjusted to see proof of concepts. After the first one 
I wanted to add in more features and slowly build another one from the ground up that is slightly more complex with more functionality. As I contine to code I will add more 
to the read me and explain more of the features and benefits of version 2.
